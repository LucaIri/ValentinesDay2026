        Hi my Love. Sorry this took so long, but I really wanted to do it this way :) 
        Making a project for you has been something I've wanted to do for a while. Personally,
         I wouldn't call this much of a project, but let it serve as a sign of more to come!!! I love you so much Miruna. Every
          day you deserve my love, and every day I enjoy being the one to deliver said love. You bring such a deep meaning to my
           life that can only be conveyed through my continued devotion to you, my Love.      </p>
      <p>
        Miruna, sweetheart, will you be my Valentine?
      </p>
